Parking Lot System Documentation
1. System Overview
The Parking Lot System manages parking operations for a multi-level facility with multiple vehicle types. It automates spot allocation, entry/exit operations, payment, and real-time spot availability tracking. The system supports extensibility for advanced features such as reservation and charging for electric vehicles.

2. Requirements
Functional:

Supports multiple levels, each with multiple parking spots.

Each parking spot accommodates a specific vehicle type (e.g., car, motorcycle, truck, electric).

Assigns available spots at entry and releases spots at exit.

Tracks and displays real-time spot availability.

Handles multiple entry/exit points.

Manages concurrent system access.

Optional Extensions:

Reservations via mobile/web app.

Electric vehicle charging.

Differentiated spot types: regular, compact, handicapped, electric.

3. High-Level Components
ParkingLot: The central management entity (Singleton).

Level/ParkingFloor: Represents a floor with its parking spots.

ParkingSpot: Represents an individual spot, tracking status and supported vehicle type.

Vehicle: Abstract base for vehicle types (Car, Motorcycle, Truck, Electric, etc.).

VehicleType: Enumeration for supported vehicle types.

ParkingTicket (optional): Tracks entry, exit, fees, and payments.

EntrancePanel & ExitPanel (optional): Hardware/software interface for ticketing and payments.

DisplayBoard (optional): Real-time status for customers.

Payment/Account/Attendant (optional): Administrative and payment logic.

4. Class Overview and Data Model
Class Responsibilities:

Class/Interface	Description
ParkingLot	Holds all levels, manages parking/unparking, Singleton access
Level/ParkingFloor	Contains list of ParkingSpots; manages spot operations per floor
ParkingSpot	Represents an individual space; knows its type and availability
Vehicle (Car, etc.)	Represents a vehicle with license details and type
VehicleType (enum)	Restricts valid vehicle types
ParkingTicket	Encapsulates entry/exit time, fee, and spot assignment
Data Relationships:

ParkingLot has many Levels.

Level has many ParkingSpots.

ParkingSpot can be associated with (at most) one Vehicle.

Vehicle has a VehicleType.

Sample Database Tables:

ParkingLot, ParkingLevel, ParkingSpot, Vehicle, User, ParkingTicket, Payment.

5. Core Algorithms
Spot Assignment: On entry, search for the nearest level and spot matching the incoming vehicle's type and assign the spot.

Release Spot: On exit, free the spot assigned to the departing vehicle via ticket/license plate lookup.

Availability Tracking: Each level and the lot aggregate and report real-time spot counts per type.

Concurrency: Critical sections (spot allocation, release) are thread-safe for multi-entry/exit operations.

6. Sequence of Operations
Customer arrives—system checks for available spot of requested type.

If available, assign spot and open gate; issue ticket (if ticketing used).

On exit, validate ticket/license plate, compute fee, process payment (if applicable), release spot.

7. UML Diagram
Classes: ParkingLot, ParkingFloor/Level, ParkingSpot, Vehicle (and subclasses), VehicleType (enum), optional: ParkingTicket, EntrancePanel, ExitPanel, DisplayBoard, Payment.

Main associations: ParkingLot 1— Level, Level 1— ParkingSpot, ParkingSpot 0..1—1 Vehicle**.

Readily-drawn with diagramming tools like draw.io or Creately; see detailed class breakdown above.

8. Design Patterns Used
Singleton: One shared ParkingLot instance.

Factory (Optional): Vehicle creation.

Observer (Optional): Notifies display board/customers about available spots.

9. Extensibility and Variations
Add reservations, user accounts, payments, fee strategies, electric charging, and real-time dashboards.

Integrate with sensors or IoT for live updates.

API endpoints for mobile/web integration.
